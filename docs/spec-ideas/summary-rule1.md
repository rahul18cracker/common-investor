## 1. Overview: Key Philosophy

- Master Rule: *Don’t lose money. Rule #2: Don’t forget Rule #1.*  
- Goal: Buy wonderful businesses at attractive prices with margin of safety, expecting long‑term returns (~15%/yr).  
- View stock as ownership in a business: analyze fundamentals, competitive strength, management, and consistency.  

## 2. The Four Ms

| M | Description |
|--|-------------|
| Meaning | Understand the business and align with your values. |
| Moat | Durable competitive advantage (brand, patent, network, etc.). |
| Management | Honest, capable, shareholder‑friendly leadership. |
| Margin of Safety | Buy below intrinsic value to protect against error. |

## 3. The Big Five Numbers

1. **ROIC** — High and consistent over 10+ years.  
2. **Sales Growth Rate** — Indicates long-term demand.  
3. **EPS Growth** — Consistent earnings expansion.  
4. **Free Cash Flow** — Owner earnings after reinvestment.  
5. **Debt Levels** — Low debt and stable during downturns.  

## 4. Valuation Methods

### Payback Time

- Time to recoup investment via owner earnings.  
- Ideal target: 7–8 years.  

### Ten Cap Method

- Valuation: Owner Earnings / 0.10  
- Looks for 10% yield on owner earnings.  

### Margin of Safety

- Estimate intrinsic value, apply 50% discount buffer.  
- Conservative assumptions: growth, discount rate, horizon.

## 5. Sticker Price & Margin of Safety

- **Sticker Price**: Target “on-sale” price for the stock.  
- **Margin of Safety**: 50% or more discount to intrinsic value.  
- Uses DCF models, growth estimates, discount rates.

## 6. Time Entry/Exit Tools

- Use technical indicators (moving averages, trends).  
- Buy when price drops below sticker price with margin.  
- Sell when price exceeds intrinsic value significantly.

## 7. Options

- **Selling Puts**: Get paid to wait for your entry price.  
- **Selling Calls**: Generate income on owned stocks.

## 8. Other Supporting Concepts

- **Circle of Competence**: Only invest in what you understand.  
- **Historical Resilience**: Long-term and recession-proof performance.  
- **Emotional Rules**: Avoid greed/fear; stick to method.  
- **Concentration**: Focused portfolio of great businesses.
