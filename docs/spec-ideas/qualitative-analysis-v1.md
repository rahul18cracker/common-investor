## 0) Who is Vitaliy Katsenelson & why his work matters

- **CEO & CIO at IMA (Investment Management Associates)**; author of two investing books — *Active Value Investing: Making Money in Range‑Bound Markets* (2007) and *The Little Book of Sideways Markets: How to Make Money in Markets that Go Nowhere* (2010) — and the personal/philosophical book *Soul in the Game* (2022). [^ima-books]  
- Known for coining/advancing the idea of **“sideways markets”** and for a pragmatic **QVG (Quality–Valuation–Growth)** framework used in research, buy/hold/sell decisions, and risk control. [^wiley-avi] [^cfa-avi]

## 1) Core philosophy for *qualitative* business analysis (Q–V–G)

### 1.1 Quality — *What makes the business durable?*

Katsenelson’s research checklist emphasizes the following quality traits: [^cfa-avi]

1) **Sustainable competitive advantages (“moat”)** — durable differentiation that protects cash flows from competition.  
2) **Predictable/recurring revenues** — subscription/consumables/embedded ecosystems that smooth earnings.  
3) **High returns on capital** — ROIC sustainably **above cost of capital**; a scorecard for value creation.  
4) **Significant free cash flow** — self‑funded growth, less reliance on capital markets.  
5) **Management quality** — honest, competent, *long‑term* oriented **capital allocators**.  
6) **Strong balance sheet** — conservative leverage increases resilience and optionality.

Related qualitative markers frequently discussed in his letters and talks:

- **Pricing power** — ability to raise prices without losing customers; protects earnings through inflation/deflation regimes. [^pricing-power]  
- **Recurrence & switching costs / brand** — ecosystems and brand equity support both recurrence and pricing. [^survive-world-trouble]  
- **Culture & “ability to suffer”** — boards/CEOs willing to endure short‑term pain for long‑term advantage. [^ability-suffer]

### 1.2 Valuation — *Process over narratives*

- Prefer **absolute valuation** methods (e.g., DCF, absolute P/E) over pure **relative** comps, especially when P/Es mean‑revert in sideways markets. [^cfa-avi]  
- **Margin of Safety (MOS)** flexes **with quality**—higher quality may allow a smaller MOS; lower quality demands more. [^ima-principles]  
- **Active value**: Have **sell criteria**; treat buy/hold/sell as equally rational decisions (not “buy & forget”). [^ima-principles] [^cfa-avi-sell]

### 1.3 Growth — *Sources & quality of growth*

- **Earnings + dividends** together drive total return; dividends also impose discipline on capital allocation. [^cfa-avi-divs]  
- Be skeptical of “growth vs. value” tribes — you need **quality + growth + value**, not ideology. [^value-growth-demagogues]

---

## 2) Practical, step‑by‑step *qualitative* analysis workflow

### 2.1 Understand the **core business** (“What does it do?”)

- Read **10‑K Item 1 (Business)** and **MD&A** to map products, customer segments, geographies, revenue drivers, and competitive landscape. (Katsenelson’s research flow stresses reading “Ks and Qs,” writing theses, and tracking competitors.) [^cfa-avi-maintenance]  
- Extract **economic engine**: where value is created, how revenue turns into FCF, and the levers (price, volume, mix).  
- Note **sources of recurrence** (subscription, replacement cycles, embedded services) and any **moat** evidence (IP, network effects, regulatory licenses, distribution, brand). [^cfa-avi]

**Example sketch (Apple, circa 2012–2024):** Katsenelson reflects on mis‑framing Apple and highlights **pricing power** and **ecosystem recurrence** — a better mental model than treating it as a commodity hardware firm. [^no-shortcuts]

### 2.2 Clarify **unit economics** through a QVG lens

Katsenelson doesn’t publish a one‑size LTV/CAC formula; instead he leans on **business‑level unit economics** consistent with QVG: sustained **ROIC above WACC**, **pricing power**, **recurrence**, and **capital discipline**.

- **Return on invested capital** and its **persistence** (is high ROIC structural or cyclical?). [^cfa-avi]  
- **Pricing power** proxies (ability to lift price, hold margins). [^pricing-power]  
- **Balance sheet** resilience (liquidity, term structure of debt). [^cfa-avi]  
- **Cash conversion** (earnings → FCF), reinvestment runway, and payout policy (dividends/buybacks) as a lens on capital allocation quality. [^cfa-avi-divs]

### 2.3 Industry/segment mapping

- “**Map the market and the world**” — follow industry ETFs, competitor sets, and macro drivers to locate where cyclicality or secular trends may amplify/undermine the moat. [^cfa-avi-discovery]  
- Identify **industry economics** (fragmentation, bargaining power, regulation) that influence **pricing power** and **ROIC** persistence (e.g., airlines historically had poor pricing power). [^airlines-pricing]

### 2.4 Compare to **top peers** (qualitative scorecard)

Use a compact **peer scorecard** aligned to QVG (weightings indicative; tailor per industry):

| Dimension | What to examine | Why it matters | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Moat** | Switching costs, network effects, brand, regulation, scale | Protects cash flows | Document examples from filings & calls |
| **Recurrence** | % recurring revenue, contract length, churn | Predictability | Prefer high recurrence with pricing escalators |
| **Pricing Power** | Price increases vs. volume retention, take‑rate stability | Inflation/deflation resilience | Cross‑check against margin history |
| **ROIC** | Level, trend, and volatility vs. peers | Value creation | Structural > cyclical |
| **Balance Sheet** | Net debt/EBITDA, maturity ladder, covenants | Shock absorption | Quality leans conservative |
| **Management** | Track record of **capital allocation**, incentives, governance | Culture & “ability to suffer” | Read letters/interviews/transcripts |
| **Dividend policy** | Payout discipline, buybacks at value | Reduces agency risk | Dividends impose frugality |
| **Valuation** | Absolute vs. implied expectations | Return drivers | MOS calibrated to quality

> Katsenelson explicitly recommends **following competitors** and **writing down** your thesis so you can revisit assumptions and **sell** when facts change. [^cfa-avi-maintenance] [^cfa-avi-sell]

## 3) Decision rules & *sell* discipline (Active Value Investing)

- **Define sell triggers ex‑ante** (target valuation ranges, thesis breaks, or better opportunities). [^cfa-avi-sell]  
- In **sideways markets**, “buy & hold” isn’t dead but **in a coma** — be **active** about trimming/adding around value and quality. [^cfa-avi-sideways]  
- **Increase MOS** when market valuations are elevated or macro fragility rises. [^ima-principles]

---

## 4) How this informs Common Investor’s qualitative modules

1) **Business Profile (Meaning)**  
   - Auto‑pull **10‑K Item 1 + MD&A**; highlight products, revenue splits, geographies, and competitor mentions.  
   - Detect **moat nouns** (network, brand, switching costs, IP) and **recurrence** markers (subscription, renewal, backlog). [^cfa-avi]  
2) **Moat Assessment**  
   - Score **pricing power**, **recurrence**, **ROIC level/volatility**, and **balance‑sheet strength**. [^pricing-power] [^cfa-avi]  
3) **Management & Culture**  
   - Parse letters/interviews for **capital allocation** philosophy, incentives, and signs of the **“ability to suffer.”** [^ability-suffer]  
4) **Industry Lens**  
   - Map peers; surface **industry pricing power** narratives (e.g., airlines vs. software). [^airlines-pricing]  
5) **Peer Comparison**  
   - Render a QVG scorecard (above) and track changes over time; attach notes to support thesis maintenance. [^cfa-avi-maintenance]  
6) **Valuation Guardrails**  
   - Favor absolute models; tie MOS to quality. [^cfa-avi] [^ima-principles]

## 5) Representative passages & where they come from

- **QVG checklist** (moat, recurrence, ROIC, FCF, management, balance sheet), discovery→research→maintenance→sell, and the case for **absolute valuation** in sideways regimes — **CFA Atlanta deck**. [^cfa-avi]  
- **Pricing power** and **recurrence** as first‑class quality markers through various macro regimes — multiple IMA letters. [^pricing-power] [^survive-world-trouble]  
- **Values of value investing** = beyond “cheap,” you need **quality & growth** (not ideology) — articles & talks. [^values-value] [^value-growth-demagogues]  
- **Active value** (sell criteria, higher MOS when fragility is high) — IMA principles page. [^ima-principles]  
- **Culture & “ability to suffer”** in management — essays & podcast. [^ability-suffer]  
- **Apple/mental models** — process humility and reframing toward pricing power & recurrence. [^no-shortcuts]

## 6) Caveats

- This guide **synthesizes** Katsenelson’s *qualitative* ideas for practical use; it **does not** include separate frameworks he hasn’t explicitly endorsed (e.g., LTV/CAC) unless they align with his QVG lens.  
- Always read originals in full; context matters.
